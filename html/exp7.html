        <h1 class="heading" id="cricket"><u>About circket : </u></h1>
        <p class="para">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game between two teams of 11 players each. One team tries to score runs by hitting the ball and running between wickets, while the other team tries to dismiss them and prevent runs. It's like baseball, but with a round bat and wickets instead of bases. There are different formats, with some matches lasting hours and others just a few!</p><hr>

        <h1 class="heading" id="formats"><u>Formats in cricket : </u></h2>
        <p class="para">The 3 formats of cricket are : </p>
        <ul class="li">
            <li>Test
            <ul class="format"><li>Considered the most prestigious and demanding format, test matches are played over five days. Each team gets two innings (tries at batting) with no set limit on overs (bowled deliveries). Matches can end in a draw if there's not enough time to bowl out both teams twice, or a team wins by dismissing all the opposing batters before they score enough runs to take the lead. </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>ODI
                <ul class="format"><li>Faster paced than test matches, ODIs are limited-overs matches where each team bats for a maximum of 50 overs (each over consists of 6 deliveries). The team with the most runs at the end wins. ODIs are known for their exciting finishes and strategic gameplay. </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>T20
                <ul class="format"><li> The shortest and fastest format, T20 cricket is known for its explosive batting and high-scoring matches. Each team gets just 20 overs to bat, making it a thrilling and action-packed experience for viewers. T20 cricket has gained immense popularity in recent years due to its fast pace and entertainment value. </li></ul>

        <h2 class="heading" id="ipl"><u>About IPL : </u></h2>
        <p class="para">The IPL, or TATA IPL, is India's biggest cricket event. It's a men's Twenty20 league, the fastest and most explosive format of the sport. Held annually during the summer, ten city-based teams battle it out in a round-robin format. Top teams then progress to playoffs, with the champion crowned in a final match. The IPL's unique feature is the inclusion of both Indian and international cricket stars, making it a global spectacle. It's not just about cricket; the IPL is a vibrant mix of high-scoring games, celebrity appearances, and a festive atmosphere.</p>
